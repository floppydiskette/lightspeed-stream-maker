## WARNING: REQUIRES AN INVITE CODE!
# usage
just run the program without any arguments, which will start the setup wizard!  
when it prompts you for an invite code, please surround it with `""` quotation marks (:
# installing
download the binary [here](https://github.com/floppydiskette/lightspeed-stream-maker/releases)  
at the moment there is only a linux binary, but this might change in the future (:
# building
this project uses the [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm),
thus it can be built by `cd`ing into the directory and running `fpm build`.  
you can then run it with `fpm run` or install the program with `fpm install`
